# Modified HNGD model

The Hydrogen Nucleation-Growth-Dissolution model was developed at Penn State to predict the hydrogen 
behavior (redistribution, hydride precipitation) in the Zircaloy nuclear fuel cladding. 

This program was coded by Florian Passelaigue, initially based on E.  Lacroix,  P.-C.  A.  Simon,  A.  T.  Motta, and J.D. Almer.  Zirconium Hydride Precipitation and Dissolution Kinetics in Zirconium Alloys. Zirconium in the Nuclear Industry: 19th International Symposium, STP 1622, pages 67– 91, 2019 (https://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/STP/PAGES/STP162220190035.htm)

The implementation of the first version of this code is presented in F. Passelaigue “Hydride Nucleation-Growth-Dissolution Model: Implementation in BISON”, Master Thesis, The Pennsylvania State University (2020) (https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/17572fpp8). The structure of the code has been modified since. The current structure is detailed in HNGD_Xcode/README.pdf

The current version (labeled mHNGD model) is based on F. Passelaigue, P.-C. A. Simon, A. T. Motta “Predicting the hydride rim by improving the solubility limits in the Hydride Nucleation-Growth-Dissolution (HNGD) model.” Journal of Nuclear Materials (submitted) 

The folder HNGD_Xcode contains a README.pdf file detailing the structure of the code and how to use it.
